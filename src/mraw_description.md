**MRAW** is an experimental project that puts together 4 ML models to show the importance of **access to clean drinking water** by highlighting the correlation between access to clean drinking water and life expectancy for children and adults.

The models were trained using [WHO global health estimates](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.686?lang=en) for the last 20 years.
